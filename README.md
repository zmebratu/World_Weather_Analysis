# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was done for the Plan My Trip, a renowned travel company that specializes in the hotel and lodging industry and assists travelers in selecting their preferred destinations worldwide based on their weather preferences.

To obtain authentic data, we made API calls to two websites, Open Weather and Google Maps, and referred to their documentation to retrieve the appropriate JSON (JavaScript Object Notations) from the cities.

The final results comprise maps displaying details of all vacation spots deemed suitable for customers. These maps can be customized based on two primary parameters: the minimum and maximum desired temperature.

To carry out this project, we employed Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy Statistics.
